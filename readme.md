# Run

To run the app, start by installing any npm packages

`yarn install`

To recompile any TS code into JS, run the following

`yarn type`

or `yarn type -w` in a separate terminal if you want the TS file to auto-compile.

(These commands are defined in package.json)

You may also opt into more TS options by modifying tsconfig.json
